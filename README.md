# Basic_Calculator
This is a basic calculator that accepts the following operators: +, -, *, / coded in python.

current takeaways:
Verson control was not utilized in this project although it would have been quite useful.

In the future I would like to improve upon this to accept more functions.

I added in a function for modulus but did not utilize it. This is my first step in future improvements.
